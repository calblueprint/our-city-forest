# Testing Folder

This folder contains code and components currently used for testing or experimentation purposes. The code here is not part of the active production application.

## Included in This Folder

### **AddTrees Screen**
- **Original Purpose:** A screen for adding multiple trees of a specific species to the database. It allows the user to:
  - Enter the species name.
  - Specify the quantity of trees to add.
  - Generate QR codes for each tree after adding them to the database.
- **Reason for Relocation:** This functionality was moved outside the app, but the screen is preserved here for reference or future testing.

## Notes
- Code in this folder should not be included in production builds.
- If functionality in this folder becomes relevant again, it should be reviewed, tested, and integrated into the main application.
